WHAT I WANT: A small, sexy, efficient yet powerful way of taking notes.

    It must be QUICK, I want to use it *right now*, without the burdensome of opening a big IDE. Vim-like light-weight text editor is preferred.

    It must follow the Zen of Zettelkasten. Each note should appear in the form of a *piece of paper* which is marked by multiple *tags*, inside it I use *concise language* to summerize what is going on, and I will be able to search *tags* and find all the papers containing this tag. Hopefully, I can build a visual graph based on the tags. [the idea of zettelkasten is genius. Using a e-version of it we will lose the pleasure of seeing papers scattering around the room, BUT we have the great advantage of building a GRAPH showing connections, and update tags and papers synchronically]


         
WHAT I WILL BUILD:
    
    USE the markdown as a piece? Use head1 as a piece? Or head2? OR ...? 
    Interprete tags? Or saving them to a file? 
    Draw the graph? 
    Where to put it?
